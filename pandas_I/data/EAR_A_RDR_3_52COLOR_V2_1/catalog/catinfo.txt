This directory contains the PDS catalog files for this data set. Instrument   
host file names end in "HOST.CAT". Instrument file names in "INST.CAT".       
Target catalog files are located in the TARGET... sub-directories. The targets
files are divided into these directories so that a single folder will not     
contain more than 100 files, and they are sorted so that the first folder     
contains the alphabetically first file and the last folder the alphabetically 
last file.
